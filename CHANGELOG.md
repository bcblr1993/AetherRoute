[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Production signing, notarization, installed Network Extension validation,
  and the final 24-hour stability gate remain release-blocking.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Initial native Swift 6 and SwiftUI macOS application source baseline.
- Transparent Proxy and Packet Tunnel/TUN Network Extension architecture.
- Typed support and isolated interoperability coverage for twelve protocol
  families.
- Encrypted profiles, subscriptions, routing, DNS, diagnostics, licensing,
  update verification, and cross-machine profile transfer.
- Pinned AetherRoute embedded-core submodule with reproducible arm64 build
  scripts and third-party notices.

### Security

- System proxy, DNS, routes, and TUN are never changed by ordinary repository
  tests; real provider tests require an explicit isolated, signed gate.
